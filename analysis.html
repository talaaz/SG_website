        <p>
          Now you know that the network is structured around super-users contributing most to the flow of question-asnwering.
          But what characterise their written language and how do they interact with other users? <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Community analysis</h3>
        <p>

          To gain a deeper insight about these super-users, we need to break down the network into more meaninful
          sub-networks called communities. By utilising community detection it is discovered that there is five 
          distinct communities.  
        </p>
        <div>
          <img class="zoom" data-scale="1.6" src="s.svg" width="100%" height="800" name="communites">
        </div>
        <p>
          Use the drop-down menu to highlight these communities. Are you able to find out what programming languages define the communities? 
        </p>
        <div>
          <center>
            <form method="" action="" name="myForm">
              <select size="1" name="switch" onchange="switchImage()">
                <option value=0>Community blue </option>
                <option value=1>Community red </option>
                <option value=2>Community green</option>
                <option value=3>Community purple</option>
                <option value=4>Community orange </option>
              </select>
            </form>
            <img src="c_b_f.png" width="100%" height="400" name="myImage">
          </center>
        </div>
        <p>
          Did you see that the blue community primarily consist of interactions between javascript related users, while
          the purple community primarily consist of Python related users. All communities tend to interact with the one main language.
          Combining the respective communities will show you that Python is the most discussed language, while Javascript is the second most 
          discussed language.<p>

        <h3>Centrality analysis</h3>
        <p>
          To understand how dependent a community is on a these super-users, it is
          interesting to analyze the network's centrality.
          Centrality measures aims at answering who is the most important or central user in a network.

          Here you see the users of the five communites by ploted against the
          betweenness centrality, quantifies the number of times a user is binding other users together, and
          the degree centrality which tells how much a user is central to it's community. Use the drop-down menu to
          highlight a specific community.
        </p>
        <div>
          <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
            src="https://plotly.com/~tato/78.embed" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>
          Does all communities have users with a significant influence? 
          Though the range of the measures vary a lot for each community, all communities have a handful of significant important users.
          This tells us, that by removing these users from each community there is a high risk that they will fall apart.
          <br>
          We define these significant important users, as the super-users of their community. Can you figure out, what language
          these super-users use?
        </p>

        <h3>sentiment analysis</h3>
        <p>
          56 super-users have been identified. In what tone do these users interact with other users?
          To investigate this a sentiment analysis is carried out on the answers posted by the super-users. 
          Sentiment analysis is briefly described a way of measuring if words is positive or negative. A sentiment score
          is ranging from 0-10, where 0 is negative. Discover the distribution of negative and positive answers.

        </p>
        <div>
          <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
            src="https://plotly.com/~tato/88.embed" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>
        </div>

        <p>
          It is worrying that most answers gets a sentiment of 5 (neutral). This could be because of the words used in
          question-asnwering often has an objective and neutral character. Another reason could be that the language
          used
          by developers differs significantly from the common english language. The latter reason is indeed very
          plausible
          since the coding language do not have much in common with the spoken language.

          <br>To find the most negative communities, we filter answers below the sentiment score of 5 and average the
          scores on community-level. The result is visualised in the next figure.
        </p>

        <div>
          <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
            src="https://plotly.com/~tato/90.embed" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>
          Can you see which community is the most negative one?

          To find out whether the sentiments makes
          sense, we need to examine what words
          these negative answers contains. A nice way
          to do this is eith a wordcloud, where words with
          high TF-IDF score gets a large font-size.
        </p>

        <h3>Wordcloud</h3>
        <p>In contrast to a regular word count, the TF-IDF score aims to find the words being unique to a community.</p>
        <p>In this section we will take a closer look at what words are
        used when the answers are considerably negative.<br>
        Swipe left to see the wordclouds of each community showing the top 30 words based on the TF-IDF score written the super-users.
        The quick observer notices that the wordclouds are plotted using logo of the respective languages related mostly to the community.
        
        
        </p>
        <div style="overflow-x:auto;">
          <table>
            <tr>

              <th>Javascript community</th>
              <th>Java community</th>
              <th>Python-Javascript community</th>
              <th>Python community</th>
              <th>Javacript-Python community</th>


            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><img src="js_c.png" width="400" height="400"></td>
              <td><img src="j_c.png" width="400" height="400"></td>
              <td><img src="p_js_c.png" width="600" height="400"></td>
              <td><img src="p_c.png" width="400" height="400"></td>
              <td><img src="js_p_c.png" width="600" height="400"></td>

            </tr>

          </table>
        </div>


        <p>
          Considering these wordclouds, do you think the words seem negative? 

          Skimming through the wordclouds, it becomes clear that the TF-IDF score is indeed able to extract words "important" for each community. 
          However, the words cannot necesarily be classified as negative. Looking at the Python wordcloud, i becomes clear that words relates to data processing problems (e.g. "list", "index","drop", "lambda", etc.).<br>
          
          Are you able to find other syntaxes that defines the communities and thereby also the code applications? Hint: examine the Python-Javascript community, and the word "selenium". How does this word relate to both Python and Javascript?
