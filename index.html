        <p> Stackoverflow is a question and answer site for everyone who codes.
          Coding is becoming an essential and must-have skill of the future, thus more people are learning how to
          program and it is easy to see that the
          tech industry is in perpetual growth.

          The StackOverflow community is of mixed of levels in mixed programming languages,
          even though the community is for sharing knowledge and helping each other, some questions can be met with a
          lot of negativity.<br>
<br>
This website aim at empowering you to investigate the flow of questions and answers, 
and wheather we can say anything about the vulnerability of this flow.
For instance, 
<a href="https://medium.com/@Aprilw/suffering-on-stack-overflow-c46414a34a52">an article posted on Medium</a>
  claims that the flow can be 
characterised as harmful, lacking in compasion, and making people feel hurt. One person even describe the 
website as â€œan adult cyberbullying playground", which leaves us to investigate weather or not these claims
can be proven by data, and stands a threat to the existence of the community.

              <li>Do users at Stack Overflow deal with multiple languages?</li>
              <li>How do users engage with each other and are some more important than others?</li>
              <li>What tone of language is used when users engage?</li>
              <li>Who are the most active users and clusters of users within the network?</li>
