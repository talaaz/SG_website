        <div class="block"></div>

        <h3>Summary statistics of the network<br></h3>
        <p>After processing all our data we can start by giving a brief summery statistics of the data, in this section
          we will get a better understading of data, networks and text.</p>
        <h3>Understanding the data<br></h3>
        <p>An thourough introduction to the data is used to get a better grasp on, what type of data is extracted and
          whether or not the information can be used for further analysis and answering the questions described in the
          Motivation.</p><br>
        <p>First of all, we investigat how many questions have been related to each of the stated scripting languages is
          done.
          , the chart below shows a histogram of haw many questions
          (the programming language on x-axis corresponds to number of questions asked into a programming language).
        </p>
        <div>
          <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
            src="https://plotly.com/~tato/1.embed" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>
          Based on the histogram, on can clearly see that most of the
          questions are asked regarding "Python", "Javascript" and "Java". which also make sense, since these languages
          are
          the most popular ones based one how often tutorials for a
          given langauge is searched on Google

          This is an interesting observation, and can have a significant impact on the further analysis, such as
          questions
          over time for each langauge, in the next figure.

        </p>


        <div>
          <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
            src="https://plotly.com/~tato/43.embed" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>

        </div>

        <p>
          One can clearly that users tend to ask fewer questions related to 'python', 'java' and 'javascript'. This is
          an interesting observation which questions whether a saturations point for the languages has been reached,
          i.e. questions posted on Stack Overflow till this date gives you necesary knowledge about the langauges. Or
          does the observation confirm the claims stated in the Motivation that the language used to answer questions
          freightens people to ask new questions.
          We will follow up on these open questions later in our analysis.
        </p>
        <p>Does the user deal with one or more languages? to answer this we find out
          all languages related to the questions posted by a user.
        </p>
        <div>
          <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
            src="https://plotly.com/~tato/45.embed" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>
          One can clearly see the user representations forming a triangle linking 'Python', 'Java' and 'Javascript'.
          This imply that we have a high concentration of users related to these three language which was
          already stated earlier. User representations placed on a straight line between two language representations
          imply that the user have only been related to two languages, while user representation diviating from a
          straight
          line have only been related to multiple languages. The user representations located in the middle of the
          langauge representations imply a
          user have been related to only one langauge.

          In fact, 2.574 user only relates to a single langauge, while 587 users relates to multiple langauges. </p>

        <h3>Understanding the network<br></h3>
        <p> The network contains 4.202 nodes representated by users and 6.846 edges connecting users,
          In order to analyze the network a weighted graph over the whole network of stackoverflow commuinty is created,
          The users nodes are colored by the the language
          they are mostly related to, and edges linking users across langauges are colored in black.
          One can clearly see that users tend to interact with
          users of same langauge, though, users 'Python' (blue)
          and 'Javascript' (red) tend to interact more.
          Thus, it can be said that 'Python' and 'Javascript'
          have more in common, which makes sense since the syntaxes are very similar.

          </center>
        </div>
        <p> To learn about the connections between users, we investigat the
          degree distribution for each langauge.
          For instance, it's possible to figure out, if all users provide
          answers to questions or if it's only a few super users providing
          answers to a bunch of questions. The distributions are visualised in
        </p>
        <div>
          <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
            src="https://plotly.com/~tato/92.embed" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>The degree plots clearly shows that almost all the
          languages have the same distribution, though the length of the tails differ a lot. For instance,
          a single user related to 'Python' has asked more than 200 questions, while only one user related to 'Java' has
          asked more than 70 questions.</p>
      </div>
      <p>

        The most interesting feature of the network is that
        all languages have a few main contributors, also called hubs.
        This becomes very clear when testing
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Do most people have fewer friends than their friends have? </b><br> answer this question
        we need to analyze the hubs of all languages therefore we do testing on the Friendship paradox.

      From the table above we can conclude that on average, 3 people interact pr. question.
      Furthermore,
      we test the Friendsship paradox saying that most people
      have fewer friends than their friends have,
      and the Friendship paradox is true e 82,4 % of the time,
      since that 824 out of 1000 random selected users, links with users that have more "friends" than them.
      </p>
      <h3>Understanding the text<br></h3>
      <p>
        The text derived for this project, is the text from the questions asked, answers given, and what the different
        users have written about themselves.
        On average 4 words are used to form a question, 190 words on average to elaborate a question and 61 words on
        average to answer a question.

        Though, these numbers come with bias, as stopwords has been removed from the text. Thus, the numbers can be
        viewed to describe only descriptive words used.
